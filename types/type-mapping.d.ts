/**
 * This type is exactly like Pick, except that it takes a union type as its
 * first argument, and returns a union of the picked types. Concretely:
 *
 * ```
 * Pick<
 *   { id: string, x: string, y: any } | { id: number, x: number, y: any },
 *   'id' | 'x'
 * >
 * ```
 *
 * returns
 *
 * ```
 * { id: string | number, x: string | number }
 * ```
 *
 * Whereas `PickEach` preserves the original structure, giving
 *
 * { id: string, x: string } | { id: number, x: number }
 *
 * The difference is that the second type, correctly, rejects an object like
 * `{ id: 'string', x: 4 }`.
 *
 * This works by exploiting that fact that conditional types distribute over
 * unions in TS.

/**
 * This type allows you to replace a type within a complex type. It works
 * recursively, so it can handle nested types as well.
 *
 * @template Type The original type.
 * @template Search The type to be replaced. Any time it -- or a subtype of it
 *   -- is found (deeply) within @see {Type}, it will be replaced.
 * @template Replacement The type to replace with.
 *
 * @example
 *  ReplaceDeep<{ a: "x" | "y", b: { c: number } }, string, number> will return
 *  { a: number, b: { c: number } }. The type of `a` is replaced b/c "x" | "y"
 *  is a subtype of `string`, even though it's not exactly `string`.
 *
 * @example
 *   ReplaceDeep<{ a: string, b: { c: number } }, "x", number> will return
 *   the first type parameter without doing any replacements. The type of `a` is
 *   _not_ replaced, b/c string is not assignable to (i.e., isn't necesssarily)
 *   the "x" that's being searched for.
